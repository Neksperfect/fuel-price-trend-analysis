#  Fuel Price Analysis in Nigeria (2021–2024)

Welcome to one of the most pressing questions in Nigeria’s economy:

**Why do fuel prices keep rising — and what’s really behind them?**

This project dives deep into 2+ years of Nigerian fuel pricing data to understand the forces shaping what we pay at the pump — including inflation, global oil prices, and the aftermath of subsidy removal.

## What This Project Covers

-  National fuel price trends before and after the **June 2023 subsidy removal**
-  Correlation between **fuel prices and inflation (CPI)**
-  Comparison with **Brent Crude oil prices** to test if global markets drive local prices
-  Regional disparities — which states pay the most (and why)
-  Real fuel price (adjusted for inflation) vs. nominal pump price

## 🔍 Key Insights

-  Fuel prices surged **over 200%** in just 2 years.

-  Strong correlation with **CPI (r = 0.91)** — fuel is a top inflation driver in Nigeria.

-  Surprisingly **weak (even negative)** correlation with **Brent crude** — meaning our fuel prices follow local forces more than global ones.

##  What You’ll Learn

- How to clean and structure real-world economic data
- How to integrate multiple data sources: local + global
- How to interpret time-series & correlation trends
- How to visualize policy effects (e.g., subsidy removal) using data

##  Let’s Talk

Got ideas for more angles (like FX, refinery output, logistics costs)?  
Want to collaborate or use this for public policy, energy research, or portfolio building?

Data is powerful — especially when it tells stories that matter.

## 📌 Bonus

This project was also featured in a [LinkedIn Data Story Post](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muoneke-nwamba-3303701a3) and built with public interest in mind.  
It’s part of my ongoing learning and portfolio work as a data analyst with a background in genomics & health.
